\section*{General Thoughts}
This chapter was heavy in theory in some sense, but also largely review of what has been covered before. I think as a reference chapter for any applications of DML beyond orthogonal least squares or semi-linear, as well as if I ever want to set up my own DML pipeline
for a method not already covered this chapter would be extremely useful. The notebooks for this chapter feel a bit bloated, but I suppose when covering and comparing so many methods it's hard to avoid. The GATE and ATET estimation is in practice much simpler than I feared,
but it seems as if a relatively intuitive approach is all it takes, which is of course very positive. I'd love a chance to apply some of these approaches to some other data.


\section*{Space for future reading}
There's nothing in this chapter that nessecarily makes we want to dig into any research, that I haven't already mentioned or that I wasn't already interested in.
