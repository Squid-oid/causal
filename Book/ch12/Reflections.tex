\section*{General Thoughts}
This chapter contianed some pretty useful content, since instrumental variables are a fact of 
life in real world applications. It does seem relatively possible to both limit and work around confounders
with the tools in this chapter, but the tools seem pretty specific, and at times arcane, so unless it's something 
you work with a great deal, or something you reread recently. 


\section*{Space for future reading}
The LATE model deserves going over again, and looking at some practical application could be very informative, but
I'm not sure if I will.
