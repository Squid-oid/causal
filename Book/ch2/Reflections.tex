\title{Reflections on Chapter 2}
\date{}

\maketitle


\section*{General Thoughts}
Again this chapter didn't really have anything new for me. It was nice to go over this stuff again so I know that I remember everything though.


\section*{Space for future reading}
It could be interesting to read some more about RCTs and trial designs in practice.
