\section*{General Thoughts}
Another chapter of mostly review, though it was very good to read about variations of Lasso,
and to have a source to reference for Lasso tuning, which has otherwise been rather vibes based 
when it's come up. Also really interesting to read about elastic net and LAVA, which I've heard of 
before but never dug into.

The exercise for this chapter was pretty interesting, reminds me 
of the course "Optimization for learning", frankly I think I've already solved it 
but in the full form, rewritten it to a dual problem and perform gradient descent on each to compare.
Anyways the intution it gives on Lasso is good to have, even though it doesn't quite hold for covaried 
explanatory variables.

\section*{Space for future reading}
The actual numerical solving of Lasso, LAVA and elastic net is something I've touched on before, but 
it'd be interesting to see if there's any really clever tricks to speed it up, since you do lose
the fantastic property of "only" having to do a matrix inversion on the Gram matrix then do some multiplication.
