    "### The debiased Lasso Method\n",

    "We suppose that some portion of $D$ might be explainable as a function of $W$ such that $D = \\gamma W + \\epsilon$, $\\tilde{D}(\\gamma) = D - \\gamma W$, and that some portion of $Y$ is explainable in both D and W, such that\n",

    "The debiased Lasso method is constructed so as to give an estimator based on a neyman orthogonal moment condition, which should give a robust estimator of $\\alpha$, $\\hat{\\alpha}$.\n",

    "The procedure is to first run a Lasso estimator connecting $Y$ to $D$ and $W$ ($X$), to get an estimator $\\hat{\\beta}$, which connects $W$ to $Y$. Next we run a Lasso explaining $D$ with $W$ to get an estimate of $\\gamma$, $\\hat{\\gamma}$. Then cfinally we find the estimator $\\hat{alpha}$ as the solution to the moment equation \n",
